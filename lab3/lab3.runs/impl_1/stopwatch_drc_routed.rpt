2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net count/pause_flag_reg_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin count/pause_flag_reg_LDC_i_1/O, cell count/pause_flag_reg_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net divide/secs_reg[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin divide/secs[5]_i_3/O, cell divide/secs[5]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT divide/secs[5]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 12 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    count/mins_reg[0] {FDCE}
    count/mins_reg[1] {FDCE}
    count/mins_reg[2] {FDCE}
    count/mins_reg[3] {FDCE}
    count/mins_reg[4] {FDCE}
    count/mins_reg[5] {FDCE}
    count/secs_reg[0] {FDCE}
    count/secs_reg[1] {FDCE}
    count/secs_reg[2] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>
